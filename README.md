## Pest'r

##### The Agriculture industry faces many challenges when addressing workplace safety.  Placing a considerable emphasis on training, education and culture has improved the conditions for employees, however there are always opportunities for improvement.  There are a number of technologies available that can be used to improve workplace hazard communications.  This application attempts to integrate those technologies, so employers and employees are able to easily communicate pertinent information, despite language barriers.  

### User Experience

##### There are three types of users.  All will be directed to a landing page where they will be required to log-in.  After logging in, they will be directed to an Google-map satellite view of the user's property.  The property will display all the designated polygons.  Any polygons that have been highlighted inicate the presence of a hazard.  An event listener will allow the user to view markers that represent the location of any fixed first-aid kits and AED's, around the property. All users will have the ability to select their language preference.  

#### Manager:
##### One user, a manager, will have the ability to create polygons and designate attributes into pre-defined attribute fields. They will also be able to layout markers for the specific items of information.  Finally, they will be able to designate which of the other employees have perimission to either create or view pesticide events.

#### Applicator:
##### The second user, an Applciator, has the ability to create events for applying pesticides. They will also have the ability to retrieve records of pesticide applications and export that information into a form that can be edited or shared, such an csv or excel. 

#### Employee:
##### The final user, an Employee, will have the ability to open highlighted polygons to see what was applied and when it will be safe to work in that environment.  They will also be able to trigger an event listener and see the markers be displayed.
